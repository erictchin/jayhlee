Working in a setting tailored to students with language based learning disabilities has made me uniquely aware and versed in micro-uniting and scaffolding lessons. Breaking down information into small, manageable amounts of information and then building on that knowledge is a key to success when working with this population. Additionally, teaching using all five senses is another key, creating lessons that are multi-modal and engage students on multiple levels is vital in making them an active member of the classroom.

    As a special educator at Landmark School, nearly half of our students are on IEPs. Because of this, I have a strong understanding of the need for assessments, as well as incorporating IEP goals and objectives into daily lesson plans, and the communication among the IEP team that is necessary for a student to succeed. While I have been a member of many IEP teams at Landmark, I personally have not been in charge of writing the IEP itself for my students. Through my education at Simmons College I have had the opportunity to write sample IEPs, and become well versed in special education law.
