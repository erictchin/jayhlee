    I have taught at Landmark School, a school for students with language based learning disabilities, for 4 years. Given our studentsâ€™ disabilities, language arts is a key component of their education. The emphasis in these classes is to help students develop the ability to express their thoughts and ideas using written language. By the time students finish their time at Landmark, and more specifically in Language Arts class, students are able to write compositions, essays, and research papers. All of my lessons are tied in to the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks and all of my lessons are multi-modal and are tailored to reach each individual learner.

    In addition to teaching Language Arts classes, I have taught 1:1 Language Arts tutorial classes. Each class is focused on working on reading fluency, comprehension, spelling and composition. Lessons are planned from the initial formal assessments done at the beginning of each year as well as ongoing informal assessments.
