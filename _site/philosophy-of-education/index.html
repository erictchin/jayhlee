    <h1>Philosophy of Education</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
    I believe that every student is entitled to an education, and has the ability to learn and acquire the information and life skills necessary to succeed. A teacher’s primary responsibility is to our students, to give them the best opportunity to gain and develop these essential life skills. With that said, I do not believe there is a one size fits all approach to education that can work in giving students an appropriate education. To that end, a teacher must approach both their role as teacher and the role of a student with an open mind, first taking the time to learn about the students and adapt to distinct learning styles, rather than force students to adapt to a specific teaching style. In order to be effective at this, educators themselves need to be students; constantly working to learn and grow as teachers. It is vital for educators to be reflective and evaluative of themselves, looking for ways to improve, as well as looking for new models and methods of teaching that they are willing to try and incorporate into the classroom.
</p>

    As educators develop and grow their personal toolbox for their trade, they are better able to approach students as individuals; prepared for students with all sorts of learning styles and needing differentiated instruction, and the flexibility necessary to meet these needs. Doing this well means that educators are self-aware of their own limitations, and not be afraid of asking for help when necessary, but more importantly educators need to create an environment where the students feel empowered and able to self-advocate and express their own ideas. As students are able to speak up for themselves, it is my belief that the students are only then able to take ownership of their education and able to help the educators meet the needs of the student.
</p>

<p>
    While every student is an individual, the one universal approach I have for education is to make it as engaging and interesting as possible. Often when talking to parents I like to describe my classes as ‘fun with learning secretly snuck in.’ Regardless of how the student learns, without a connection with the educator and the material, the student will not reach anywhere close to their full potential as a learner. Overall, to be successful as a teacher I believe one needs to be flexible and willing to try new things to engage and empower students, and a key in doing this is by being dynamic and engaging to draw students into the learning process.
