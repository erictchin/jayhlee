    In addition to teaching at Landmark, I am also one of the live-in faculty members. For the past 6 years I have lived in various dorms on campus and helped provide support and community building to students in a residential setting. At times this has meant taking students leaf raking and doing other various community outreach events, and also building community within the dorm by creating and hosting dorm nights with my colleagues or taking students on various trips in and around the city of Boston.
</li>
<li>
    Additionally, I am an active member of my church, <a href="www.citylifeboston.org">Citylife Church of Boston</a>, and have served the church in various capacities. For the last 8 years I have taught Sunday school, working with children ages 5-14. Over the past 8 years, I have also held other responsibilities such as small group leader, curriculum writer, and operations coordinator for the University Ministry.
</li>
<li>
    Also, I am an occasional contributor to the <a href="http://www.centerforgospelculture.org/author/jay-lee/">Center of Gospel Culture</a>, writing various articles that pertain to faith, literature, and culture.
